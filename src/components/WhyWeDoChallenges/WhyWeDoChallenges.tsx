      <p>
        Most individuals do not know which kind of career that they would like to do. So rather then investing time, energy and money into a
        career that we think isn't the right now for you, we do challenges in advance of you setting for the course so you can determine
        whether this is the program that would make the most sense. As a benefit for all the students who join the challenge, at the end of
        the challenge we give you a significant discount to join the course and you will only get that discount if you take the challenge.
