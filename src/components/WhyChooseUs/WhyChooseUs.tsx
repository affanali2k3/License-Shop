          We are completely different. We couldn't be more different even if we wanted to. We think that the current system is completely
          broken. We don't even think it we know it. Current across the United States 50% of the students fail the exam. Of the ones that
          pass only 25% survive the first year. It tells you that the system is completely broken and it needs complete reform. We believe
          the reform needs to happen in multiple ways

            process, our systems that we guarantee that you are going to make six figures in your first year. How can we do that? Its
            because we have systems and processes that we have refined via our students and the founder himself. We provide accountability
            and coaching to make sure that you stay on path and that if you have issues and problems we bring you back because we want to
            make this as simple as possible but that does not mean that there will not be hard work. You will have hard work to do but you
            will know what you need to do and you will have resources in terms of accountability and coaching to make sure you can get back
            onto track and get to your goal and surpass your goals
